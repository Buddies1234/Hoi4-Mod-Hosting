  afu_rework.1.d:0 "[ETH.GetName] is demanding that we put our African colonies from Egypt to Rhodesia into their care. This will undoubtedly strengthen their position. Handing over the territory could benefit us in the long run, making [ETH.GetName] more receptive to any diplomatic overtures we decide to make. Nonetheless, our grip on Africa will be weakened.\n\nThey have made it explicitly clear that the Suez will stay in our posession."
  afu_rework.6.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has requested another concession to our African holdings, this time demanding South Africa in totality. South Africa is much more developed than the rest of Africa and could strengthen [FROM.GetName]'s position substatially."
  afu_rework.2.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has approached our diplomats with a rather... interesting proposal. They essentially said that they want full control over all of French West Africa including our colony in madagascar. They seem to be making moves of aggressive decolonisation. Whilst this obviously goes against our interests, refusing could make us look bad.\n\nThey have given us the option of holding onto Algeria, as they do at least understand they we have been looking to integrate it into our republic proper. Though the real reason why they can condede on Algeria is that they likely will find \"defrenchifying\" Algeria to be tedious."
